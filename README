Hardware Excuse Generator

Do you know why your hardware isn't working as expected? Me neither! But it's important to have a plausible excuse when you explain it to people. Enter the Hardware Excuse Generator.

You can see the generator in action here: http://natashenka.ca/hardware-excuse-generator

Feel free to contribute excuses, just make sure you add them in both the commandline and web version. And the goal here is to come up with plausible and professional sounding excuses, so nothing like "the alignment of the planets" or "my lab partner screwed up".
