The circuit behaved in a manner that was inconsistent with the design due to REASON. The voltage across the main power rail fluctuated more than ten volts in either direction during normal operation due to REASON, and spurious data corrution was noted in the RAM due to REASON. Attempts to further diagnose the source of the problem were unsucessful due to REASON and REASON. We recommend futher analysis to rule out REASON.
